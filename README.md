# SourceTree alfred workflow
Search bookmarks in SourceTree and launch them via Alfred.

![usage demo](assets/usage-demo.gif)

*Credits*: This is a swift clone of [Alfred_SourceTree](https://github.com/yourtion/Alfred_SourceTree) by [yourtion](https://github.com/yourtion). Due to the latest release of macOS 12.3, python2 has been removed, which broke the original workflow. So I reimplemented this workflow in Swift. It should be much more stable and faster.

## Features
1. support fuzzy search
2. can open repo in your code editor directly by press <kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>enter</kbd>, using VS Code by default, you can [custom it](#custom-your-preferred-code-editor)
3. can reveal repo in find by press <kbd>option</kbd> + <kbd>enter</kbd>


## Install
### Prepare
1. you must have [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) installed
2. you should have unlocked [Powerpack in Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/powerpack/)
3. make sure you have `swift` available in terminal.(**If you have `Xcode` installed, you can skip this step.**):
   1. type `swift --version` in terminal, if you don't see any version info output, following next step to install it.
   2. type `xcode-select --install` in terminal to install swift cli tools


### Install

[download workflow](https://github.com/oe/sourcetree-alfred-workflow/raw/main/SourceTree.alfredworkflow) then click the downloaded file to install

Promotion: using [sourcetree-custom-actions](https://github.com/oe/sourcetree-custom-actions) to add useful actions for SourceTree

## Usage

launch alfred then input `st` and `keyword` separated with a space to search bookmarks, press enter to launch the bookmark in SourceTree.

Additionally:
> select a bookmark,  press `cmd` + `enter` to open the repo in your favorite code editor, see [how to custom code editor](#custom-your-preferred-code-editor)
> select a bookmark,  press `option` + `enter` to reveal the repo in Finder


## Build script to binary
If you are using an old Intel Chip Mac, you may experience the unbearable lagging, that's because of Swift JIT Compiler is pretty slow on Intel Chip.

You can follow the following steps to compile the workflow script to binary to speed up its response speed.

> enter `st $compile` in Alfred then press `enter` key

If you are using Apple Silicon Macs(like M1, M1 Pro), you can also compile the workflow for better performance


## Custom your preferred code editor
1. Open Alfred Preferences panel
2. find and click the `SourceTree` in **Workflows** list
3. click `Configure Workflow...` button bellow the workflow name
4. change the value of `Code Editor Config`, , multiple values can be set depending on the file extensions in the folder.

   Example:
   ```sh
   # configuration format:
   # [editor cli name]=[extension1, extension2,...]
   # extension case does not matter
   # example, using Xcode for XCode projects
   xed=.xcodeproj,.xcworkspace,package.swift

   # using vscode for default
   code=*
   ```

   The order of the list is important, the first one that matches will be used.

   Here are some common editors' cli names:

   1. `code` for VSCode (default)
   2. `xed` for Xcode
   3. `subl` for Sublime Text
   4. `webstorm` for WebStorm
   5. `idea` for IntelliJ IDEA 

   Tips: 
   1. If your preferred editor not available in CLI, make sure you've append it's binary file's directory to the `PATH`
   2. You may need to authorize Alfred to access the folders containing the repos., see [here](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/getting-started/permissions/)

5. click `save` button to save variable settings
6. click the bug üêû icon in the top right to show the debug log
7.  try yourself, if it works, congratulations; if not, check the debug log, make sure the cli name is existing and correct, and `PATH` contains your cli
